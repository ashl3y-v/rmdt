- [x] `rtg_preds` are critic
- [x] Decaying learning rate
- [x] Loop, check what Lookahead is
- [ ] Compression (have to change attention mask, make explicitly size of history)
- [x] Gaussian policy stdev (make product of model)
- [x] Covariance matrix
- [x] Make RTG be RTG/steps
- [ ] Getting random NaNs in loc
- [ ] R_pred only sees past states and actions, perhaps take last as critic value

- [ ] do the vitmae thing
